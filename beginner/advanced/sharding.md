# Sharding

### What Is Sharding?
Sharding is the method in which a bot's code is 'split' into multiple instances of itself. When a bot is sharded, each shard handles only a portion of all the servers that the bot is in.

### When Is Sharding Needed?
Sharding is usually needed when a bot hits 2,000-2,500 servers.

### How Do I Shard With d.js-BDScript?
You don't have to do anything, d.js-BDScript has the ability to shard automatically (when needed)! 

### How Do I Find What Shard A Server Is On?
You can use the `$shardID` function, to get what shard a server is on.

[WarningMsg] You may notice slower response times on sharded bots, if this happens; you should contact your host provider.
