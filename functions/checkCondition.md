# $checkCondition
 `$checkCondition` serves as a way to make a true or false statement.

Example: `$checkCondition[$username==Spen]`
The bot would return "true" if someone named Spen used the command, otherwise it would return "false".

However, if you made $checkCondition like this: `$checkCondition[$username!=Spen] `
Then it would return "false" if someone named Spen used the command, otherwise it would return "true".

## Usage
```$checkCondition[value(sign)value] ```

### Whats Sign?

== - Must be equal 

!= - Must be not equal 

< Must be less than (only numbers) 

\> - Must be greater than (only numbers) 

=> - Must be greater than or equal to (only numbers) 

<= - Must be less than or equal to (only numbers)
