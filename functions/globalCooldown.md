# $globalCooldown
Applies a cooldown to the command, the user can not run the command in any server until the 'duration' is up. (Unlike `$cooldown`, which only applies the cooldown to the user in the current server)

## Usage
```
$globalCooldown[duration;errorMessage]
```

### Breakdown
`duration` - The duration until the user can use this command again.

`errorMessage` - The message to return when the cooldown duration is still ongoing.

[InfoMsg] Tip: You can use `$data[time]` to get how much time is left until the cooldown is over, in the 'errorMessage'.
